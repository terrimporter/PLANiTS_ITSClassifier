# PLANiTS ITS reference set for the RDP Classifier

Here is the method I used to convert the QIIME-formatted PLANiTS files for use with the stand-alone version of the RDP classifier.  It has only been tested on the QIIME formatted PLANiTS release 29_03_2020 available from https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS .  It is currently trained to the species rank.  Leave one sequence out testing is currently in progress.

The PLANiTS v1 training files and trained files ready for use with the RDP classifier are available at https://github.com/terrimporter/PLANiTS_ITSClassifier/releases .
